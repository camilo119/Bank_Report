## Overview

The Bank Loan Report and Dashboard project aims to provide insights into loan data for a bank. By leveraging SQL for data analysis and Power BI for visualization, the project offers a comprehensive understanding of loan performance and trends.

## Data Import and Analysis

The loan data, initially stored in a CSV file, was imported into an SQL Server for analysis. Various SQL queries were executed to extract valuable information such as total loan applications, total funded amount, total amount received, average interest rate, and average debt-to-income ratio (DTI).

## Power BI Dashboard

The project culminates in the creation of a dynamic dashboard using Power BI. The dashboard presents key metrics and insights in an interactive and visually appealing manner, allowing stakeholders to gain valuable insights into loan performance.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

- **Total Loan Applications**: The total number of loan applications received.
- **Total Funded Amount**: The total amount of funds disbursed for approved loans.
- **Total Amount Received**: The total amount received from borrowers.
- **Average Interest**: The average interest rate across all loans.
- **Average DTI**: The average debt-to-income ratio of loan applicants.

## Visualization

The dashboard includes visualizations such as:
- **Donut chart**: Separates loans into good and bad categories based on performance metrics.
- **Area Chart - Loan Funded Amount**: Graphical representation of the amount funded for each loan.
- **Loan Total Received**: Graphical representation of the total amount received for each loan.
- **Shape Map - Loan Applications by State**: Distribution of loan applications by state.
- **Stacked Bar Chart - Purpose of the Loan**: Breakdown of loan applications by purpose.

## Slicers

The dashboard incorporates slicers to enhance interactivity and enable users to filter and drill down into specific data segments. Slicers allow users to dynamically adjust the displayed data based on criteria such as loan type, state, loan purpose, etc.

## Conclusion

The Bank Loan Report and Dashboard project provides a comprehensive analysis of loan data, empowering stakeholders to make informed decisions and strategies. By leveraging SQL for data analysis and Power BI for visualization, the project offers valuable insights into loan performance and trends, driving better business outcomes.
